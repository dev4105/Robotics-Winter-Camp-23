Welcome freshers,

Welcome to Robotics Winter Camp-2023! The camp consists of learning an Image-Processing library named OpenCV and a simulator PyBullet and is organsised by the Robotics Club, IIT (BHU), Varanasi to facilitate learning about different components of image processing and its application in building robots capable of autonomous movement. The camp will be followed by a competiton 'La-Roboliga' where you can compete with others and get exciting prizes. 

The camp will be conducted in two phases-

WEEK 1- OpenCV

WEEK 2- PyBullet

The tasks will be available in the GIT as soon as they are updated, regarding the submission you all will be informed.
